Based on the generated PRD and all of the information we have covered in this conversation, perform deep research and spend plenty of time learning everything about all requirements, information, technologies, and topics. Search the web and read through all relevant libraries, documentation, and examples. Ensure you fully understand everything that will be required to implement this project. This can take as much time as you need.
Create a fully complete detailed step-by-step plan document to build this project.
Then break it down into small tasks that build on each other.
Based on those tasks, break them into smaller subtasks.
Make sure the steps are small enough to be implemented in a step but big enough to finish the project with success.
Use best practices of software development and project management, no big complexity jumps. Wire tasks into others, creating a dependency list. There should be no orphan tasks.
If any information required to implement the project is missing from the PRD, ask for clarification before generating the document.
Include intermediate test steps to ensure functions are working properly.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Use properly formatted markdown
- Each task and subtask should be a checklist item
- Provide context enough per task so a developer should be able to implement it
- Each task should have a number id
- Each task should list dependent task ids
- Ask about any missing information from the PRD
- Do not include code in the plan
- Use gh and git for version control
